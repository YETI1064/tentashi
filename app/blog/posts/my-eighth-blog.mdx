# Binary Tree!!!

Today, I am going to upload a file that I created before.
Its about the Binary Search Tree. In it we can add functions like we can search specific words and multiple words that we have in text.
Not only search words it can also search numbers. And we can also add time to find how many time it has taken to find words or number given by us.

That's all for now!!!
