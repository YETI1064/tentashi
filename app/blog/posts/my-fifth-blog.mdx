# Computer Science 101 for Beginners

What is Algorithms?
A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

Uses of the algorithms :-
1) Computer Science: Algorithms form the basis of computer programming and are used to solve problems ranging from simple sorting and searching to complex tasks such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
2) Mathematics: Algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems, such as finding the optimal solution to a system of linear equations or finding the shortest path in a graph.
3) Operations Research: Algorithms are used to optimize and make decisions in fields such as transportation, logistics, and resource allocation.
4) Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms are the foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are used to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making.
5) Data Science: Algorithms are used to analyze, process, and extract insights from large amounts of data in fields such as marketing, finance, and healthcare.
