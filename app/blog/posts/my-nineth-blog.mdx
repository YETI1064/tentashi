# Contributing on Github!!!

For the few days, I have started working on issue in 'freecodecamp' which is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free.
So in that, I pick up a issue and start to work on it. Before that I fork it and run it on VSCode.
The issue that I worked on is perfectly fine in my page, So I didn't find any issue to work on.
I also leave a comment below the issue. I think the person who raised this issue didn't update his/her browser.

After that, I picked another issue and it's just a 'suggestion' It's a intresting topic to work on so I choose to work on that.
Before I start working on that issue I need to read and understand their code contribution and many more.

On next blog, I will let you know how I work on that issue.
