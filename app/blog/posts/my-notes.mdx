# How to make changes ?

You make any changes to the file, or if you add a new file, it needs to tracked

- `git add filename or .`
- `git commit -am "I have changed some or added a blog"`


Then once you have commited something , then you must push it that means, it should go to your giuthub repo

- `git push -u origin main`
